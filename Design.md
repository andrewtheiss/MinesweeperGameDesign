# Functionality

## Rules

In classic Minesweeper, there is a rectangular grid with mines scattered throughout (traditionally 16x30 with 99 mines). A player can click on any of the squares.

- If a player clicks on a square with a mine, they lose.
- If a player clicks on a square without a mine, then the square reveals the number of mines adjacent to it (a number from 1-8).
- If a revealed square does not have any mines adjacent to it, then every square around it is revealed automatically (which in turn can reveal more squares with no adjacent mines).
- The player can mark squares where they believe mines are.
- If a player reveals all of the squares that do not contain mines, they win (they do not have to mark every square with a mine).

## Player

In this version of Minesweeper, the player is a controllable 2D player. They should be able to run around the physical Minesweeper board with the camera following them. Their field of view will be limited, but there should be a hotkey to show a map of the entire board (perhaps **M**).

The player should be able to do the equivalent of “clicking” on a square by facing in the direction of the square and pressing **space** or **enter**. This should give the player multiple possibilities of squares to click on, much like how one would move a king on chess.com. Right-clicking on a square will flag it, and left-clicking on a square will reveal it.

### Other Gameplay Mechanics

- The player should start with three “lives” (or hearts on the bottom left corner of the screen).
- If a player discovers a bench, they should be able to interact with it by pressing **space** or **enter**, and gain an extra heart.
- If a player clicks on a mine, they should lose a heart, and the mine should be marked with a black Mine (not a heart).
- The player should be able to walk around on revealed squares only.
- During play, all revealed squares should have a low probability of giving the player a new cosmetic to customize their character. This probability should increase depending on the number revealed.

## UI Elements

- Whether the player ultimately wins or loses, a little postgame screen should pop up that details the total time (in seconds) spent playing the game and how many squares were revealed. If the player has previously won, also show their best time.

## Difficulty Levels

- There should be 5 difficulties in the game which are stylized based on the environment of said country.  The difficulties in order of least to most difficult should be as follows:
- Ukraine
- Afghanistan
- Cambodia
- Bosnia and Herzegovina
- Vietnam
  The game should NOT explain which one is more difficult or why, but allow the user to choose the difficulty level and the apprpriate complexity and difficulty will be chosen.
 
## Map Generation

- The player should start automatically on a random square with no mines.
- The board should be pseudo-randomly generated in such a way that no guessing is necessary.
- The shape of the board should be randomly generated as well, to make the experience more novel.

# Visuals

### Theme

- **Pastel pixel art**: Nothing should be too overwhelming.
- Numbers on the board should be in high contrast against their backgrounds.
- The player should play as a customizable character (example default dog sprite included in the pdf).
- Classic Minesweeper numbers, flags, and mine sprites should be overlaid on the following tileset.
- If there is room on the board (where there are no numbers to be obstructed), add trees, water, bridges, and benches randomly as little easter eggs to discover.
- Unrevealed squares should look like this (mines can be placed on top of it without changing the texture).

# Layout

- The Minesweeper board should occupy the majority of the screen.
- While the game is being played, have a counter in the top left that details how much time has been spent on the current board (in seconds).
- On the top right, have a counter that says how many mines remain unmarked.
- On the top middle, there should be a reset button that allows the player to start a new game.
- On the bottom right, there should be a minimap that pops out when clicked.
- On the bottom left, there should be a settings gear where the player can customize their character.
